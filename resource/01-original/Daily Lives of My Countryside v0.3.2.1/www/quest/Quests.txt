Maybe... this mess is partly my fault.
Helping more feels like the least I can do...

Aunt Douie brought over a stallion.
Big, loud, and full of energy.
She says he’s a gift to the farm.
Feels more like a Ferrari with hooves.
Better go check it out.

Mae might’ve been half-joking...
but she wasn’t all that wrong.
The stallion makes work way faster—
still not sure Auntie Daisy can handle him solo.
Better check in and give her a hand.

The stallion helps, no doubt about that.  
But the farm’s still too much for one person.  
It’s better... just not enough.  
I need to find another way.

We’ve got him in check now.  
Not just a stallion—he’s family.  
Still does the heavy lifting, of course.

Okay... what the hell?  
Either Elphaba hit me with some witch 
curse, or I took a shovel to the head.  
I turned into a damn horse.  
Better check again tonight to be sure.

Bit surprised Auntie Daisy's taking 
Mae's advice...  
Well... I’m a horse now. 
Help with this, help with that...
This counts as helping too... right?

That feeling was unreal.  
And it’s stuck in my head.  
I know I shouldn’t—
but I can’t stop thinking.  
Tonight... I’ll sneak in again.

That was unexpected...  
Didn’t think she’d go that far.  
Left my soul somewhere in that barn.  
Not complaining. 
Honestly... 
I’m looking forward to what’s next.

Lately, things keep bugging me.  
I haven’t been sleeping well.  
It’s been raining, and I’m not sure 
the barn’s okay.  
Might as well check it tonight.

...That wasn’t normal.  
But I think she’s doing it for the farm.  
Maybe this is what Mae meant... 
or maybe not.  
Either way—I need to see more.

I think this is normal... right?  
I’ve heard horse owners do this stuff.  
It looked... kinda interesting.  
And honestly? I don’t think I hate it.

That wasn’t just routine.  
I can’t believe I’m jealous of 
a damn horse.  
Alright... this is getting interesting.  
Not sure if I wanna watch or... join.
